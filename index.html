        <p>Welcome to Katie's Cookies! Founded in 1876 deep in rural Wisconson, Katie's Cookies began as a direct response to Reconstruction Era fiscal policies. A woman of resolve and deep patriotism, Mama Katie couldn't abide the repatriation of those traitorous Southern Devils into our now Free Nation.</p>
        <p>To combat the influence of Cotton Money in her great state of Wisconson, Mama Katie started baking and selling Katie's Cookies to the local parishes. These cookies were made almost entirely of sawdust and gristle, but the children and parishioners loved them just the same. Mama Katie took all the proceeds from her first 5 years sales and put them towards anti-Southern efforts; Her influence in the political sphere couldn't be overstated. After instilling president Woodrow Wilson in our Lords year 1913 Mama Katie grew fatigued of this mortal plane. One evening she retired to her study and was never seen again.</p>
        <p>Here at Katie's Cookies we believe in carrying on the spirit of Mama Katie through aggressive pricing, heavy guerilla marketing, and regular seance with the realm of the deceased. Enjoy our Free Trade cookies, sold individually or by the dozen, and ruminate on the illusion of freedom you've been fed since birth. Down with the Oligarchy! Up with Katies Cookies!</p>
